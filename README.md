# Category-Level 6D Pose Estimation

This code is for our CVPR2021 oral paper: FS-Net: Fast Shape-based Network for Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation with Decoupled Rotation Mechanism. (I will upload the code as soon as possible, thanks for you patience.)

## Contributions
Our framework is built on our previous work [G2L-Net](https://github.com/DC1991/G2L_Net), with the following Contributions:
 1. New latent feature learning  
        >>> [3D graph convolution](https://github.com/j1a0m0e4sNTU/3dgcn/issues) based observed points reconstruction

 2. New rotation representation  
        >>> Decomposable vector-based rotation representation

 3. New 3D data augmentation  
        >>> Box-cage based, online 3D data augmentation
